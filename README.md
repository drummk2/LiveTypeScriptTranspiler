# LiveTypeScriptTranspiler
A minimal single-page web app that lets a user paste TypeScript on the left and instantly view the transpiled JavaScript on the right. Built with TypeScript for the site code itself, powered by a browser-loaded TypeScript compiler for near-instant in-browser transpilation.
